I have created 3 key frames for now displaying a basic idle 'breathing' animation.
Each frame should hold for about 0.2 seconds/or at least 3 frames (I'm not sure how animation works on unity).
I noticed just now that the facial features don't move with the head but I will fix that by next week (or most likely friday).

If you have any problems feel free to message me.

The animation sequence should move like this:

Frame 1, Frame 2, Frame 3, Frame 2 (then repeat to create a loopabale sequence).
